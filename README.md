    <h2>Welcome</h2>
    <p>Hello! I'm Rodrigo Cartagena,</p>

<p>I grew up in Bolivia, a country with huge mountains, dense jungles, and wide, open spaces that can feel like a different world. Since getting from one place to another wasn't always easy or cheap, airplanes were like magic. They could fly over the Andes, cut through the Amazon, and connect people in just a few hours. That wonder from childhood soon became a genuine passion.</p>

<p>Because of my passion for flying, I immediately became interested in STEM fields, particularly math, physics, and astronomy. I even had the privilege of competing internationally on behalf of Bolivia! The most important thing I've learned from every obstacle is that you can't merely admire airplanes; you must know about them, find ways to improve them, and ensure that flying is affordable and accessible for everyone.</p>

<p>But science isn't everything! I also love music—learning to play the violin and piano has taught me that often the greatest way to grasp the world is via a melody—astronomy, which reminds me how small and magnificent we are in the universe, and chess, which taught me to think a few steps ahead constantly.</p>

<p>I enjoy seeing amazing places, learning about different cultures, and traveling. Every journey motivates me to set higher goals and put in more effort to create a future where flying is accessible, easier, and cleaner.</p>

<p>I appreciate you joining me on this journey to build a world where technology preserves the environment, fosters human connection, and makes advancement accessible to everyone!</p>

<p>Additionally, never forget that the sky is only the beginning!</p>

  <h3>Sky Match: Fighter Jets</h3>
  <p>
    It is a matching pairs game, which requires players to find and identify concealed cards, recognizing the name, model, and key features of the aircraft. This improves working memory and focus, which decline with age but can be maintained with mental training. It also boosts visual and spatial memory, which helps the brain establish new neural connections and build cognitive resilience. Moreover, improving or winning boosts self-esteem and delight, making it more than a mental workout.

  <h3>Blue Sky Builders</h3>
  <p>
    Reimagining aviation's future is the goal of this game, not merely building airports or flying planes! Players learn sustainability tactics and enjoy competition and collaboration by making wise choices to cut CO₂ emissions. It's a fun, hands-on method to promote greener skies and demonstrate that innovation and sustainability coexist. Every move contributes to a better tomorrow.

  <h3>Skyward Emissions: How Aviation Fuel Use Has Changed — and What It Means for Climate Change</h3>

  <p>Aviation is a small share of global energy use but punches above its weight in climate impact. Over the last decades, new aircraft and operations have made flying far more fuel-efficient. Still, global jet fuel consumption and the climate footprint of the sector remain large — and the industry faces a steep challenge to decarbonize at the scale and speed climate science demands.</p>

  <h4>What the data show</h4>
  <p>Global jet fuel demand fell during the COVID shock but rebounded quickly as travel recovered. The <a href="https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/charts/global-aviation-fuel-consumption-2013-2021" target="_blank">IEA’s historical charts</a> show year-by-year jet-fuel consumption trends (2013–2021) and are a good starting point for plotting recent recovery and pre-pandemic growth.</p>

  <p>Longer-term efficiency gains are real: analyses by the <a href="https://theicct.org/publication/aviation-global-jet-aircraft-fuel-burn-jan25/" target="_blank">ICCT</a> find the average fuel burn of newly delivered jets decreased by roughly 43% from 1970 to 2024, averaging about a 1% per-year reduction in block fuel intensity. Those gains come from better engines, lighter airframes, and improved operations — but improvements have slowed recently.</p>

  <p>Yet despite efficiency gains, sustainable fuels and zero-carbon propulsion are still tiny in the overall fuel mix. The <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/aviation" target="_blank">IEA</a> notes SAFs account for well under 1% of aviation fuel consumed today — meaning nearly all jet fuel burned is fossil kerosene.</p>

  <p>Finally, the policy and industrial picture is mixed: <a href="https://www.icao.int/environmental-protection/CORSIA/Pages/default.aspx" target="_blank">ICAO’s CORSIA mechanism</a> and airline pledges aim for net-zero by 2050, but reporting and offset integrity remain contested; recent <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/sustainable-business/exclusive-airlines-sustainable-fuel-plans-face-delays-cancellations-data-shows-2023-09-14/" target="_blank">reporting</a> has shown many announced SAF projects have stalled or failed, limiting near-term supply growth.</p>

  <h4>Why aviation matters for climate</h4>
  <p>Aviation emissions are unique: aircraft emit CO₂ at altitude, and contrails and other non-CO₂ effects (NOₓ, contrail cirrus) multiply their warming impact. Even if aviation stays a single-digit percentage of global CO₂ today, rapid post-pandemic traffic growth without meaningful fuel replacement would push cumulative warming higher — a problem climate models flag as significant for reaching Paris targets.</p>

  <h4>Solutions & what big companies are doing</h4>

  <h5>Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF)</h5>
  <p>SAF (HEFA, waste-to-jet, power-to-liquid) can cut lifecycle CO₂ vs fossil jet fuel, but supply is tiny and production is expensive. Airlines and oil/energy firms have launched SAF partnerships and offtake agreements (for example <a href="https://www.united.com/en/us/fly/about/sustainability" target="_blank">United’s SAF program</a>), but many announced projects have been delayed or canceled, and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/sustainable-business/exclusive-airlines-sustainable-fuel-plans-face-delays-cancellations-data-shows-2023-09-14/" target="_blank">independent reporting</a> shows only a small fraction of announced SAF plants are operational.</p>

  <h5>Hydrogen and fuel cells / combustion</h5>
  <p>Aircraft makers are exploring hydrogen long-term. <a href="https://www.airbus.com/en/innovation/zero-emission/hydrogen/zeroe" target="_blank">Airbus</a> has public ZEROe hydrogen concept work and continues R&D into hydrogen fuel-cell and turbine concepts; startups like <a href="https://www.zeroavia.com/" target="_blank">ZeroAvia</a> are developing hydrogen powertrains, though the commercial path to scale is uncertain.</p>

  <h4>Future work</h4>
