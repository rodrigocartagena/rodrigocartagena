    <h2>Welcome</h2>
    <p>Hello! I'm Rodrigo Cartagena,</p>

<p>I grew up in Bolivia, a country with huge mountains, dense jungles, and wide, open spaces that can feel like a different world. Since getting from one place to another wasn't always easy or cheap, airplanes were like magic. They could fly over the Andes, cut through the Amazon, and connect people in just a few hours. That wonder from childhood soon became a genuine passion.</p>

<p>Because of my passion for flying, I immediately became interested in STEM fields, particularly math, physics, and astronomy. I even had the privilege of competing internationally on behalf of Bolivia! The most important thing I've learned from every obstacle is that you can't merely admire airplanes; you must know about them, find ways to improve them, and ensure that flying is affordable and accessible for everyone.</p>

<p>But science isn't everything! I also love music—learning to play the violin and piano has taught me that often the greatest way to grasp the world is via a melody—astronomy, which reminds me how small and magnificent we are in the universe, and chess, which taught me to think a few steps ahead constantly.</p>

<p>I enjoy seeing amazing places, learning about different cultures, and traveling. Every journey motivates me to set higher goals and put in more effort to create a future where flying is accessible, easier, and cleaner.</p>

<p>I appreciate you joining me on this journey to build a world where technology preserves the environment, fosters human connection, and makes advancement accessible to everyone!</p>

<p>Additionally, never forget that the sky is only the beginning!</p>

  <h3><strong>Canguro Matematico - Bolivia</strong></h3>
  <p>It is the Bolivian branch of Kangourou sans Frontières, the world's most significant international mathematics competition. The Sociedad Boliviana de Educación Matemática and the Olimpiada Matemática Boliviana organize it to encourage mathematical thinking and problem-solving skills in students from third grade in elementary school to sixth grade in secondary school.</p>

  <h3><strong>Team Infinitum</strong></h3>
  <p>A reputable organization for its excellence in preparing young people for national and worldwide arithmetic competitions. Their programs focus on advanced mathematical theories, logical thinking, and problem-solving techniques to give participants excellent comprehension and appreciation of mathematics.</p>

  <p>The Bolivian American Center (CBA) in Santa Cruz, Bolivia, is home to this young astronomy group. They aim to pique children's and teenagers' interest in and enthusiasm for the stars! They host astronomy workshops, telescope evenings, and even departmental astronomy Olympiads for younger students, among other entertaining and instructive events. Additionally, AstroCBA is pleased to send students to compete internationally, such as the Latin American Astronomy Olympiads, on behalf of Bolivia.</p>

  <p>Fundamentally, AstroCBA's goal is to introduce young people to the cosmos one starry night at a time.</p>

<h3><strong>Virtual Flight School Bolivia (EVV)</strong></h3>
  <p>A pioneer organization in Bolivia for online aviation education was established in 2022 and uses cutting-edge flying simulators, such as Virtual Reality (VR) technology, to provide theoretical and hands-on training programs. Through its courses, students can obtain experience in a highly realistic setting before flying real aircraft, ranging from introductory levels for kids to programs for private and commercial pilots. </p>

  <h3>Black Holes</h3>
  <p>
    In my webinar about black holes, I explained how these mysterious giants can absorb and change the energy and matter of nearby stars to grow even bigger. I used simple examples and cool pictures to make it easy for everybody to understand. I loved talking about one of the most incredible things about the world, and I hope it makes more people want to stay interested and keep exploring space.

  <h3>Sky Match: Fighter Jets</h3>
  <p>
    It is a matching pairs game, which requires players to find and identify concealed cards, recognizing the name, model, and key features of the aircraft. This improves working memory and focus, which decline with age but can be maintained with mental training. It also boosts visual and spatial memory, which helps the brain establish new neural connections and build cognitive resilience. Moreover, improving or winning boosts self-esteem and delight, making it more than a mental workout.

  <h3>Blue Sky Builders</h3>
  <p>
    Reimagining aviation's future is the goal of this game, not merely building airports or flying planes! Players learn sustainability tactics and enjoy competition and collaboration by making wise choices to cut CO₂ emissions. It's a fun, hands-on method to promote greener skies and demonstrate that innovation and sustainability coexist. Every move contributes to a better tomorrow.

  <h3>3D Printer</h3>
  <p>
    My favorite tool is my 3D printer! I use it to build scale aviation models and custom parts to realize my ideas. Designing something on a computer and seeing it evolve is fascinating. My 3D printing projects teach me about aerodynamics, engineering, and problem-solving.

  <h3>Wings Over Houston Airshow - Blue Angels</h3>
  <p>
    Jet engines roar at Ellington Airport's Wings Over Houston Airshow every fall when the U.S. Navy Blue Angels perform. These expert Boeing F/A-18 Super Hornet pilots do stunning feats that amaze spectators.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Blue Angels' performance is the airshow's highlight, drawing aviation fans and families. Their synchronized aerobatics, tight formations, and high-speed passes show naval aviation's best. But the fun continues! The Wings Over Houston Airshow also showcases historic World War II aircraft, modern military displays, and civilian aerobatics.
